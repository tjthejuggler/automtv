0	18800	Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
18800	30800	Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscopes eyes
31800	41800	Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head
41800	48800	Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone
49800	64800	Lucy in the sky with diamonds
65800	78800	Pull her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
79800	91800	Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high
92800	101800	Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away
102800	108800	Hang in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone
109800	124800	Lucy in the sky with diamonds
125800	139800	Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
140800	152800	Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with kaleidoscopes eyes
152800	181800	Lucy in the sky with diamonds
182800	206800	Lucy in the sky with diamonds
