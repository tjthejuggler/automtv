1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscopes eyes

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Pull her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high

8
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away

9
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Hang in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone

10
00:01:49,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters with looking glass ties

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with kaleidoscopes eyes

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

14
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
