00:00.000 --> 00:18.800
Picture yourself in a boat on a river With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

00:18.800 --> 00:30.800
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly A girl with kaleidoscopes eyes

00:31.800 --> 00:41.800
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green Towering over your head

00:41.800 --> 00:48.800
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone

00:49.800 --> 01:04.800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

01:05.800 --> 01:18.800
Pull her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

01:19.800 --> 01:31.800
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers That grow so incredibly high

01:32.800 --> 01:41.800
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore Waiting to take you away

01:42.800 --> 01:48.800
Hang in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone

01:49.800 --> 02:04.800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

02:05.800 --> 02:19.800
Picture yourself on a train in a station With plasticine porters with looking glass ties

02:20.800 --> 02:32.800
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile The girl with kaleidoscopes eyes

02:32.800 --> 03:01.800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

03:02.800 --> 03:26.800
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
